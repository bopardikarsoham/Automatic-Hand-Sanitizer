# Automatic Hand Sanitizer
As part of my college's 'Microcontrollers and Applications(MCA)' course, I designed an automatic hand sanitizing system using the MSP430F5529 microcontroller.

## Components Used:

1) Ultrasonic sensor - Detects the presence of a hand.
2) Servo motor - Automatically sprays sanitizer on the hand based on the reading of the ulrasonic sensor.
3) 5V DC Power Supply
